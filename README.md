# Description
This is my first actual project and was inspired by me learning how to create a basic player with basic controls. The premise is simple: Jump on floating sofas to outrun a sandstorm. This project is very pivotal for my development and learning with the UI elements and developing in an Object-Oriented manner. Although it is very basic and without a satisfying end-screen, this game will hopefully be playable without too many glitches.

### Built in C# using the Unity Engine
The program requires you to download the Trampoline Sofa Release html and unity3d files, place them into the same folder, then launch the html file. An Internet browser that can run the Unity web plug-in, such as Mozilla firefox or Internet Explorer, is required to play.
